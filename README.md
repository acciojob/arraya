# Arraya

## Instructions

Once upon a time in the peaceful village of Arraya, two rival merchants, Alice and Bob, owned and operated fruit stands next to each other. They were known for having the best fruits in the village, sorted meticulously by their weight.
One day, the village chief decided to host a grand feast and asked Alice and Bob to supply fruits for the event. However, he wanted the fruits to be sorted in ascending order by their weight. Realizing that working together would be beneficial, Alice and Bob decided to merge their stocks for the feast.
Can you help Alice and Bob create a function that combines their sorted arrays of fruit weights into a single sorted array?

````Input:
Two sorted arrays of integers, representing the weights of Alice's and Bob's fruits.
Output:
A new array containing the integers in ascending order, representing the combined and sorted weights of Alice's and Bob's fruits.```

## Example:

````

mergeFruitWeights([1, 5, 9], [2, 4, 7, 10]); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]

```

```
